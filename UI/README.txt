The directory contains the vce graphical interface library.

vceMainWindowGUI.py has been auto-generated by pyuic from
vceMainWindowGUI.ui and should not be edited manually as all changes
will be lost.

vceMainWindowGUI.ui is the main program window, generated by Qt
Designer.  If vceMainWindowGUI.ui is edited (by Qt Designer or
otherwise) then vceMainWindowGUI.py must be updated to reflect the
changes. This can be done by executing the following command in
vce-desktop/UI:

pyuic4 vceMainWindowGUI.ui > vceMainWindow.py

The GUIresoures directory contains graphical files used by the UI
(such as icons). It will be auto-loaded into Qt Designer when
vceMainWindowGUI.ui is opened. If the resource file is modified then
GUIresources_rc.py must be updated. This can be done by calling the
following from the command line while in the GUIresources directory:

pyrcc4 GUIresources.qrc > ../GUIresources_rc.py

Just make sure pyrcc4 is in your path. In Windows Anaconda python
environments it's not in there by default. It can generally be found
in C:\Users\USERNAME\Anaconda2\Library\bin.
