# VCE Desktop
Visual Chemical Engineering Desktop Application

The vce project aims to deliver chemical engineering principles in a way that sticks. By placing the user in control of common unit operations and providing dynamic, graphics-based responses, users may develop a deeper understanding of these systems. Under the bonnet, vce is powered by years of chemical engineering knowledge, brought to you through the power of [Python](https://www.python.org/).
